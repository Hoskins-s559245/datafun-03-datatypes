Working with List.


Terminal Results:
List 1 Tasks are as follows:

The Mean of List y is:  108  The Median is:  106.5  The Mode is:  131
The Standard Dev is:  33.11  and the variance is:  1218

List 2 Tasks are as follows:
Calculating the future prediction between two lists provides:  225.31  at future value 15
The correlation percentage between the teo list is:  0.96

List 3 Tasks are as follows:
The Minimum value on the list is:  64  The maximuim value on the list is:  158  The Length of the list is:  10 The Sum of the List is: 1086
The Length of the Average of the list is:  109  The Set of the List is {64, 96, 131, 69, 72, 117, 155, 93, 158}
The List being sorted directly is:  [64, 69, 72, 93, 96, 117, 131, 131, 155, 158]
The List being reversed sorted is:  [158, 155, 131, 131, 117, 96, 93, 72, 69, 64]

List 4 Tasks are as follows:
Appended list with the value 700:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 700]
Extended list with a 2nd list:  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 700, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93, 117, 131, 131, 158, 155]
Inserted value of 277 at position 5 of the list  [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 277, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 700, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93, 117, 131, 131, 158, 155]
Removed 700 from the list [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 277, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93, 117, 131, 131, 158, 155]
The number of times 93 exists in the list is:  1  Times
Display the list sorted [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 64, 69, 72, 93, 96, 117, 131, 131, 155, 158, 277]
Display the list reverse sorted [277, 158, 155, 131, 131, 117, 96, 93, 72, 69, 64, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]
The first element in the list:  0
The Resulting list after the removal of the first elemental is [1, 2, 3, 4, 277, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93, 117, 131, 131, 158, 155]
The Last Element on the list is  155
Removal of the Last element in the list results the final list of:  [1, 2, 3, 4, 277, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93, 117, 131, 131, 158]

List 5 Tasks are as follows:
Elements in the list that are less than or equal to 100 [87, 86, 89, 81, 92, 100, 75, 76, 99, 91, 84, 74, 87, 86, 86, 75, 87, 88, 89, 95, 81]
Using a map to take the cube root of the list [1.   1.26 1.44 1.59 6.52 1.71 1.82 1.91 2.   2.08 4.16 4.1  4.   4.58
 4.53 4.89 5.08 5.08 5.41]
Calculating the volume of a list of sides: Starting list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 277, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93, 117, 131, 131, 158]
Resulting list of Volumes is [1.0, 8.0, 27.0, 64.0, 21253933.0, 125.0, 216.0, 343.0, 512.0, 729.0, 373248.0, 328509.0, 262144.0, 884736.0, 804357.0, 1601613.0, 2248091.0, 2248091.0, 3944312.0]

List 6 Task list are as follows:
Utilize List Comprehension to get values of 100 or less [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 72, 69, 64, 96, 93]
Utilize List Comprhension to raise each element to the power of 3: Used list y for simpler display [373248.0, 328509.0, 262144.0, 884736.0, 804357.0, 1601613.0, 2248091.0, 2248091.0, 3944312.0, 3723875.0]
